we have two way:
1. Github-hosted runner (standard)
2. Self-hosted


- Github hosted:
---  Managed service (no need to setup the infra)
---  steps shared the VM

- Self-hosted:
--- Run workflow on any infra
--- Full control on the VM
--- Self-Managed
--- Add at repo/org/enterprise level
--- Jobs not have to run on clean instances

*** Do not run self-hosted runner in public repo
